description: Commit changes using conventional commits
---

Commit the current changes using conventional commit format. Never attribute model or opencode. Never use emojis, never be friendly. Always use separate commits if makes sense. Analyze the changes and create appropriate commit messages following the conventional commit format: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore. Group related changes by component and create separate commits for different types of changes.
